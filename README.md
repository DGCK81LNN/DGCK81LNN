while this README has more friendly links (and every link to Wikipedia has an alternate link which is accessible in
and only in Mainland China).

# üëã Hello, I'm DGCK81LNN, an ordinary Chinese senior high school student.

## My interests are...

### Computer programming

My father being a software engineer, I began to learn coding at quite a young age.

<details><summary>Details</summary>

  * Web front-end

    I'm used to developing using Vue.js or plain JavaScript and enjoy creating utility tools or something like that.
    In development, I pay attention to compatibility with mobile devices and screen readers (because I like to use my
    own tools on mobile ~~and with my eyes closed~~).

  * Python, Ruby, Node.js &mdash; convenient coding ecosystems

    I enjoy ~~creating useless programs~~ use coding to solve problems I encounter in my other hobbies (music, music
    games) as well, and package managers make that much easier.

  * [Esoteric programming languages][1] ([alternate link][2])

    "Esolangs" test the boundaries of the concept of "programming languages". My favorite esolangs are [Brainfuck][3]
    ([alternate link][4]), [Befunge-93][5] ([alternate link][6]) and [Wenyan][7].

  * Unity

    Got to know about Unity from the [*Dancing Line*][8] ([alternate information in Chinese][9]) [fan labor][10]
    ([alternate link][11]) community, and have dedicated to DL fan labor development the whole time. I hope one day I
    can create an easy-to-use fan-level developing environment that more people can use.

</details>

### [Music games][12] (MUG, [alternate link][13]) and MUG-like games

Got into the community from the game [*Dancing Line*][8] ([alternate information in Chinese][9]), and later tried
*Malody* ([official website][14]), [*osu!*][15] ([alternate link][16]), *Phigros* ([information in Chinese][17]), and
*A Dance of Fire and Ice* ([official website][18], [information in Chinese][19]).

### [*My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic*][20] ([alternate link][21], [alternate information in Chinese][22])

Got to know the show from the fan game [*Pony Town*][23] and the fan fiction [*The Last Pony on Earth*][24] ([Chinese
translation][25]). "Innocent Souls" ([tag on Derpibooru][26]) is my [ponysona][27] and I sometimes do draw fan art.

## Contact me / More about me

You can reach me using the email address provided on my GitHub profile. Unfortunately, I currently haven't posted any
extra information about myself in English. **To those who understand Chinese:**

  * You can subscribe to [my channel on Bilibili][28] where I occasionally post videos about *Minecraft*, *Dancing
    Line* fan labor and *My Little Pony*.

  * I have a [profile page on the Chinese Wikipedia][29] ([alternate link][30]) which presents more information about
    me.

  * You can also contact me via QQ (3470524928).

Hope I can become friends with you!
