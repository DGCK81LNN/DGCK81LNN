# üëã Hello, I'm DGCK81LNN, an ordinary Chinese student.

## My interests are...

### Computer programming

My father being a software engineer, I began to learn coding at quite a young age.

<details><summary>Details</summary>

  * Web front-end

    I'm used to developing using TypeScript or just plain JavaScript. In development, I pay attention to accessibility
    with mobile devices and screen readers (cos I often use my tools on mobile, ~~and sometimes use them without
    looking at the screen~~).

  * Python, Ruby, Node.js

    I enjoy solving problems that I encounter in my other hobbies via coding. I like Ruby because it seems to be an ‚Äúelegant‚Äù
    programming language, and I usually use it to experiment my ideas. I often use Node, too, due to its close relevance
    to the Web. Python is not my favorite programming language but there are times when it is the only sensible choice.

  * [Esoteric programming languages][esolang]

    Esolangs test the boundaries of the concept of "programming languages". [Brainfuck][brainf], [Befunge-93][befunge] and
    [Wenyan][wenyan] are my favorite esolangs.

  * Unity

    I got to know about Unity from the [*Dancing Line*][dlwiki]<sup>[[zh]][dlzh]</sup> [fan labor][fanlabor] community
    and have tried creating my own level. I failed though, because the currently existing open-source DLFM template
    projects fail to satisfy my needs. I wish to create a easier-to-use template project with a more orderly and extensible
    codebase than that of existing templates. Currently I'm not working on this very often, due to limited free time.

</details>

### [Music (rhythm) games][mug] (MUG) and MUG-like games

Brought to the Chinese MUG community by the MUG-like game [*Dancing Line*][dlwiki]<sup>[[zh]][dlzh]</sup>, I later tried
*Malody*, [*osu!*][osu], *Phigros*<sup>[[zh]][phigr]</sup>, and *A Dance of Fire and Ice*<sup>[[zh]][adofai]</sup>. *osu!*
is the MUG I play the most.

### [*My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic*][mlpfim]<sup>[[zh]][mlpfimzh]</sup>

It was my friend Danny who recommended to me the show and I have watched mostly the entire show, from Season 1 to Season 9.
I did skip some of the episodes and I haven't watched it a second time &mdash; I'll probably do that in the future.
"Innocent Souls" is my [ponysona][ponysona] and I occasionally do some fan art; I don't think I'm very good at drawing though.

### Other stuff

  * I have played *Undertale* and *Deltarune* Chapter 1-2
  * I've been playing *Genshin Impact* on the **Asia** server, join me! UID: 857179228
  * I've been playing [*Alice In Cradle*][aic]<sup>[[zh]][aiczh]</sup> which is still in beta
  * I've just started to play *Blue Archive* on the **Chinese** server
  * I'm a fan of [Neuro-sama][neurosama]<sup>[[twitch]][neurosamatwitch]</sup>, the AI VTuber.
  * I have some basic understanding of the [constructed languages][conlang] [*Lojban*][lojban], [*Toki Pona*][tokipona] and
    [*Shidinn*][shidinn]<sup>[[zh]][shidinnzh]</sup>.

## Contact me / More about me

  * You can reach me using the **email address** shown on my GitHub profile.

  * Contact me via **Tencent QQ** if you have an account: 3470524928.

  * ~~Try **Twitter** too, but I doubt if I will see notifications promptly due to my location (China Mainland):
    [@DGCK81LNN][mytwitter]~~ (no; i am now certain i wiil **not** see twitter notifications promptly)

  * Those who understand Chinese can subscribe to [my channel on Bilibili][mybili] where I occasionally post videos
    and/or stream.

Don't hesitate to get in touch with me for anything you have in mind, or just a chat if you like! ü§ù
