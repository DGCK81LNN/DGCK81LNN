# üëã Hello, I'm DGCK81LNN, an ordinary Chinese senior middle school student.

## My interests are...

### Computer programming

My father being a software engineer, I began to learn coding at quite a young age.

<details><summary>Details</summary>

  * Web front-end

    I'm used to developing using Vue.js or plain JavaScript and enjoy creating utility tools or something like that.
    In development, I pay attention to compatibility with mobile devices and screen readers (cos I like to use my
    tools on mobile, ~~and sometimes, use them without looking at the screen~~).

  * Python, Ruby, Node.js &mdash; convenient coding ecosystems

    I enjoy ~~creating useless programs~~ using coding to solve problems I encounter in my other hobbies (music, music
    games) as well, and package managers really make things easier.

  * [Esoteric programming languages][esolang]

    "Esolangs" test the boundaries of the concept of "programming languages". My favorite esolangs are [Brainfuck][brainf],
    [Befunge-93][befunge] and [Wenyan][wenyan].

  * Unity

    I got to know about Unity from the [*Dancing Line*][dlwiki] ([alternate information in Chinese][dlzh]) [fan labor][fanlabor]
    community and have tried creating my own level. I failed though, because the currently existing open-source DLFM
    template projects fail to satisfy me. I have been trying to create a template project (or rather, a developing
    environment) that is easier to use and whose code is more orderly and extensible.

### [Music games][mug] (MUG) and MUG-like games

Got into the community from the MUG-like game [*Dancing Line*][dlwiki] ([alternate information in Chinese][dlzh]), and later
tried *Malody*, [*osu!*][osu], *Phigros* ([information in Chinese][phigr]), and *A Dance of Fire and Ice* ([information
in Chinese][adofai]).

### [*My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic*][mlpfim] ([alternate information in Chinese][mlpfimzh])

Got to know the show from the fan game [*Pony Town*][ponytown] and the fan fiction *The Last Pony on Earth*. "Innocent Souls" is my [ponysona][ponysona] and I sometimes do draw fan art.

## Contact me / More about me
