# üëã Hello, I'm DGCK81LNN, an ordinary Chinese senior high school student.

## My interests are...

### Computer programming

My father being a software engineer, I began to learn coding at quite a young age.

<details><summary>Details</summary>

  * Web front-end

    I'm used to developing using Vue.js or plain JavaScript and enjoy creating utility tools or something like that.
    In development, I pay attention to compatibility with mobile devices and screen readers (cos I like to use my
    tools on mobile, ~~and sometimes, use them without looking at the screen~~).

  * Python, Ruby, Node.js &mdash; convenient coding ecosystems

    I enjoy ~~creating useless programs~~ using coding to solve problems I encounter in my other hobbies (music, music
    games) as well, and package managers really make things easier.

  * [Esoteric programming languages][1]

    "Esolangs" test the boundaries of the concept of "programming languages". My favorite esolangs are [Brainfuck][3],
    [Befunge-93][5] and [Wenyan][7].

  * Unity

    I got to know about Unity from the [*Dancing Line*][8] ([alternate information in Chinese][9]) [fan labor][10]
    community and have tried creating my own level. I failed though, due to the fact that the currently existing open-source
    DLFM template projects fail to satisfy me. I have been trying to create a template project (or rather, a developing
    environment) that is easier to use and whose code is more orderly and extensible.

</details>

### [Music games][12] (MUG) and MUG-like games

Got into the community from the MUG-like game [*Dancing Line*][8] ([alternate information in Chinese][9]), and later
tried *Malody*, [*osu!*][15], *Phigros* ([information in Chinese][17]), and *A Dance of Fire and Ice* ([information
in Chinese][19]).

### [*My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic*][20] ([alternate information in Chinese][22])

Got to know the show from the fan game [*Pony Town*][23] and the fan fiction *The Last Pony on Earth*. "Innocent Souls" is my [ponysona][27] and I sometimes do draw fan art.

## Contact me / More about me

You can reach me using the **email address** provided on my GitHub profile. Unfortunately, I currently haven't posted any
extra information about myself in English.

Those who understand Chinese can subscribe to [my channel on Bilibili][28] where I occasionally post videos about *Minecraft*, *Dancing Line* fan labor and *My Little Pony*.

You can also contact me via QQ (3470524928) if you have an account.

Hope I can become friends with you!
