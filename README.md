# üëã Hello, I'm DGCK81LNN, an ordinary Chinese senior middle school student.

## My interests are...

### Computer programming

My father being a software engineer, I began to learn coding at quite a young age.

<details><summary>Details</summary>

  * Web front-end

    I'm used to developing using TypeScript or just plain JavaScript. In development, I pay attention to accessibility
    with mobile devices and screen readers (cos I like to use my tools on mobile, ~~and sometimes, use them without
    looking at the screen~~).

  * Python, Ruby, Node.js

    I enjoy solving problems that I encounter in my other hobbies via coding. I like Ruby because it seems a somewhat ‚Äúelegant‚Äù
    programming language, and I usually use it to experiment my ideas. I often use Node, too, due to its close relevance
    to the Web. Python is not my favorite programming language but there are times when using it is the only sensible choice.

  * [Esoteric programming languages][esolang]

    Esolangs test the boundaries of the concept of "programming languages". [Brainfuck][brainf], [Befunge-93][befunge] and
    [Wenyan][wenyan] are my favorite esolangs.

  * Unity

    I got to know about Unity from the [*Dancing Line*][dlwiki]<sup>[[zh]][dlzh]</sup> [fan labor][fanlabor] community
    and have tried creating my own level. I failed though, because the currently existing open-source DLFM template
    projects fail to satisfy my needs. I wish to create a easier-to-use template project with a more orderly and extensible
    codebase than that of existing templates. Currently I'm not working on this though, due to a lack of time.

</details>

### [Music games][mug] (MUG) and MUG-like games

Got into the community from the MUG-like game [*Dancing Line*][dlwiki]<sup>[[zh]][dlzh]</sup>, and later tried *Malody*,
[*osu!*][osu], *Phigros*<sup>[[zh]][phigr]</sup>, and *A Dance of Fire and Ice*<sup>[[zh]][adofai]</sup>.

### [*My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic*][mlpfim]<sup>[[zh]][mlpfimzh]</sup>

It was my friend Danny who recommended to me the show and I have watched mostly the entire show, from Season 1 to Season 9.
I did skip some of the episodes and I haven't watched it a second time &mdash; I'll probably do that in the future.
"Innocent Souls" is my [ponysona][ponysona] and I occasionally do some fan art, despite the fact that I'm not very good at
drawing.
